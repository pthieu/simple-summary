Every driver knows to stop at a red light, but you may want to be extra diligent about how exactly you “stop.” 
Peel Region has a system of red light cameras designed to catch drivers who don’t stop properly at red lights.
Did you know if you don’t fully stop when making a right hand turn at a red light, you will find yourself with a ticket to pay. 
The cameras are on 24/7 and photograph any vehicle that runs a red light. The cameras will also record the date and time of the incident, the vehicle’s license plate and speed it was going, and even the length of time that the red light was active. 
The set fine for running a red light is $325. Of the 26 cameras installed in Peel, 15 are located in Mississauga:
